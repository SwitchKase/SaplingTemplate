<objective>
Manage GitHub repositories through the gh CLI with sane defaults (private repos, proper error handling).
</objective>

<essential_principles>
- All repos created are **private by default**
- Check authentication before operations: `gh auth status`
- Use `gh repo` commands, not raw git for GitHub operations
</essential_principles>

<intake>
**Commands:**
1. `/github list` - List your repositories
2. `/github create <name>` - Create new private repo
3. `/github clone <repo>` - Clone a repo locally
4. `/github visibility <repo> <public|private>` - Change visibility
5. `/github new-project <name> --from <boilerplate>` - Create from template

<error_handling>
Common errors and resolutions:
- **Not authenticated**: Run `gh auth login`
- **Repo already exists**: Check with `gh repo view <name>` first
- **Permission denied**: Verify you own the repo or have admin access
- **Rate limited**: Wait and retry, or use authenticated requests
</error_handling>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Operation completes without error
- [ ] User informed of result (repo URL, local path, etc.)
</success_criteria>
